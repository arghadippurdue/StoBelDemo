This repository contains demo videos for the ISLPED 2025 Design Contest paper:

**"A Low-Power Real-Time Hardware Accelerator for Edge Detection Using Stochastic Computing"**

## Overview

The provided videos showcase the functionality of our proposed stochastic computing-based edge detection accelerator. Please refer to the following files:

- `Demo1.mp4` – Demonstration with the first input case.
- `Demo2.mp4` – Demonstration with the second input case.

These demos highlight the efficiency and real-time performance of our design on different types of input data.
